# tutorial-golang-concurrence

This repository contains a series of Go code examples demonstrating concurrency patterns and techniques using Go channels. These examples cover a variety of concurrency-related topics such as synchronization, flow processing, fan-in, fan-out, and more.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a collection of practical examples that utilize Goâ€™s powerful concurrency model, primarily focusing on the usage of channels to manage concurrent tasks efficiently. Each file demonstrates a specific concurrency pattern or technique, making it easy for developers to learn and implement these patterns in their own applications.

## Files

- **chan_fan_test.go**: Demonstrates the fan-in concurrency pattern, where multiple goroutines send data to a single channel.
- **chan_map_test.go**: Implements a map-based concurrency solution, typically used for managing key-value pairs in a concurrent environment.
- **chan_mutex_test.go**: Shows how to use channels for mutual exclusion (mutex), simulating lock behavior without using the `sync.Mutex` type.
- **chan_ordone_test.go**: Illustrates the concept of ordered execution and ensuring specific operations are performed in a desired order using channels.
- **chan_pool_test.go**: Implements a goroutine pool using channels, which helps in managing a limited number of concurrent workers.
- **chan_stream_test.go**: A flow processing example using channels, showcasing how to handle streaming data with concurrency.

## Features

- **Synchronization Control**: Learn how to synchronize goroutines using channels instead of traditional locking mechanisms.
- **Flow Processing**: Examples of handling data streams and processing them concurrently.
- **Fan-in and Fan-out**: Demonstrating how to aggregate data from multiple goroutines (fan-in) and distribute data to multiple goroutines (fan-out) using channels.
- **Channel Patterns**: Various techniques for utilizing channels for safe communication between goroutines.
